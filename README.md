# GA SEI Neptune Project Showcase

As an Instructional Associate for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program, I'm helping a group of 24 fellows achieve their goal of becoming software engineers. Throughout the program, I and my fellow instructors guided students in the Neptune cohort through creating 4 projects each over the course of 3 months (April-July 2020). This site showcases these projects.

## Technology Stack
- Backend RESTful API built with Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL
- Frontend User Interface built with React.js
