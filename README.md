# GA SEI Neptune Project Showcase

From April - July 2020, I worked as an Instructional Associate for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program, helping a group of 24 fellows achieve their goal of becoming software engineers. Throughout the program, the instructional team guided students in the Neptune cohort through creating 4 projects each. This site showcases these projects.
